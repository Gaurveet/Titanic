Titanic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.

Project Structure

- `train.csv` — Titanic dataset (raw data).
- `titanic_eda_notebook.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook containing full code, visualizations, and insights.
- `titanic_eda_report.pdf` — PDF report summarizing key findings and observations.

Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

Key Explorations

- Dataset overview and basic statistics.
- Univariate analysis: Age, Fare, Passenger Class, Gender.
- Bivariate analysis: Survival rate vs Gender, Class, and Age.
- Multivariate analysis: Correlation heatmaps, pairplots.

Key Insights

- Females had a higher survival rate compared to males.
- 1st Class passengers had a better chance of survival.
- Children and younger passengers had better survival rates.
- Passengers who paid higher fares generally had a higher survival rate.

Note

- The dataset `train.csv` was sourced from the Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster competition on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).
- No model training (ML) is performed — this project focuses purely on 'exploratory data analysis'.
